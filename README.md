## This repository contains the code, schematic, and layout for a wifi controlled and monitored 5V 3A regulator that works with __open-automation__.

### open-automation is made from a cohesive set of web languages. NodeJS for general processing, socket.io for bidirectional communication. NodeJS is used for generating, setting, and retreiving model (mongodb) data. Websockets is used for transport on microcontrollers. Live token based streaming with JSMPEG decoding on camera devices. Web interface is angularjs. Android app for location beacons. Now supports streaming from behind routers, this is done through websockets; so no port forwarding necessary!

### Can be used for controlling cameras, dead bolts, garage openers, lights, thermostats, media, glass break, and a customizable alert system.
